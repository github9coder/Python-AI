You need to install openai and colorama for this to work.

- ### openai
    #### (Used to create the Artificial Intelligence):
    ##### Using pip:
    ```
    pip install openai
    ```
    
    ##### Using conda:
    
    ``````
    conda install openai
    ``````
    <br>
    I recomend you update conda if necessary with:
    
    ``````
    conda update conda
    ``````
    as a new version has made install time very quick (conda 24.3.0).

- ### colorama
    #### (Used to colour and format when interacting with user.):
    ##### in pip:
    ```
    pip install colorama
    ```
    ##### in conda:
    
    ```
    conda install colorama
    ```
