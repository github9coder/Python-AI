## Create an OpenAI API key.
1. Navigate to the [OpenAI website](https://platform.openai.com/).
2. Create an OpenAI account.
3. Verify your account.
4. Log in.
5. In the left menu, click API keys.
6. Create a new secret API key. Remember to store it, as OpenAI won't show it again.
7. In the python code, change {your_API_key} by your API key. 

You also need to install openai and colorama for this to work.

- ### openai
    #### (Used to create the Artificial Intelligence):
    ##### Using pip:
    ```
    pip install openai
    ```
    
    ##### Using conda:
    
    ``````
    conda install openai
    ``````
    <br>
    I recomend you update conda if necessary with:
    
    ``````
    conda update conda
    ``````
    as a new version has made install time very quick (conda 24.3.0).

- ### colorama
    #### (Used to colour and format when interacting with user.):
    ##### in pip:
    ```
    pip install colorama
    ```
    ##### in conda:
    
    ```
    conda install colorama
    ```
